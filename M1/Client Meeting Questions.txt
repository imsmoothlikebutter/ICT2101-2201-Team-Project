Confirmed questions:
1.         Is the chief the one who allocate and plan workload? Do they need to schedule their workload through the Workload Management System also? 
(If yes, does officers & leaders submit their availabilities every wed?)

2.         We would like to confirm the roles. Are the Staffs => Leaders, Officers? And Chiefs are Managers
•          What's the access level of each role (4 roles given: IT admin, Chief, leaders and officers). Also any difference in access level between site leader and area leader?
•          Will reporting be done through the management system? If yes, what is the reporting hierarchy and what does it entails?

3.         What does the Chief need to see/visualize on the Workload Management System when overseeing the sites?

4.         How do you quantify the workload assigned? Is it by hours or the type of site?

5.         Do you track standby manpower (E.g Available, Standby, Unavailable, Assigned etc.)

6.         Do want the workload management system to track attendance (on the actual day, signing out) like a clock-in, clock-out feature
•          Do you want the system to automate last minute changes or leave it up to Manager?
•          Who can edit staffs’ hours?

7.         What does point 4 mean: "The manager should be able to view up to three staff availability and any relevant information to make the job assignment easier on the job allocation page" 
Do you just want to see any 3 available staffs’ names or is there a specific way you want it to be sorted?
